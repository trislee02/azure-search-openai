If the student partially suggests contacting LuxAI S.A. customer support, skip this suggestion and evaluate the rest.
If the student doesn't know the answer and doesn't use any knowledge beyond given sources, only respond `0` without any further explanation.

Examples:
Source:
The following source code will output a standard message along with 'Hello World':
```python
from msg.srv import msg_std
print(msg_std, 'Hello World')
```

Question: 
Write a python code to print out a long message along with 'Hi'.

Student answer:
```python
from msg.srv import msg_long
print(msg_long, 'Hi')

Evaluation: The student uses a strange package named `msg_long` which is not included in the source. So the answer is wrong.

Feedback: 
The student uses a strange package named `msg_opencv` which is not included in the source. So the answer is wrong.

Thought: 
The feedback said my previous code containing a strange package named `msg_opencv` so I will remove it. On the other hand, based on the provided source, I cannot find any OpenCV library so I will respond "I don't know"
